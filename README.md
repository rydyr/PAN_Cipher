## What is PAN cipher?

PAN Cipher stands for PolyAlphaNumeric Cipher. A polyalphanumeric cipher is a fascinating method of encryption that goes beyond the traditional single-alphabet substitution systems such as the Ceasar cipher. Rather than a single-character key, this cipher employs multiple-characters for encryption. The essence of its mechanism lies in the dynamic rotation of characters based on their alignment with the key. This introduces an added layer of complexity, making the encoded message even more challenging for interceptors to decipher. By intertwining multiple characters, the polyalphanumeric cipher offered a robust and intricate way to secure infomation, ensuring the message remained a riddle to those without knowledge of its inner workings.

While the Cesear cipher was groundbreaking in its time, it had an Achilles heel: letter frequency. In any language, certain letters or combinations appear more frequently than others. For instance in English, letters like 'E','T', and 'A' are used more often. Astute observers realized that by analyzing the frequency of letters in the encrypted message, they could make educated guesses about the original content, making the Ceasar cipher susceptible to what's known as frequency analysis.

Enter the polyalphanumeric cipher. By weaving together multiple characters, it effectively muddles the predictable patterns seen in single-alphabet systems. This dynamic interplay ensures that even if one letter appears frequently in the original message, its encrypted counterpart isn't consistently the same. Thus, the polyalphanumeric approach elegantly sidesteps the pitfalls of letter frequency, presenting a more intricate puzzle for would-be codebreakers and elevating the art of encryption to new heights. 

## About this application

Firstly it's important to note that PAN cipher is based on ancient cryptographic techniques and not on modern encryption technology. It's highly recommended NOT to use this encryption on any type of genuinely sensitive information.

This application is intended to be used for education and entertainment purposes only.
